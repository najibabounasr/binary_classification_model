# binary_classification_model
A neural network powered model, used to help VC funds sort through funding applications.  

# Background

To predict whether Alphabet Soup funding applicants will be successful, we can create a binary classification model using a deep neural network.

The program uses a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from a VC firm over the years. The CSV file contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not it ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.
